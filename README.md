Summary Cards (a.k.a SUC) is a simple extension for displaying distinct content
summaries on hovered links.

The content of a Summary Card is created by a template is assigned to the namespace
of the hovered link and requested via [Ajax][ajax].

The extension does not require [Semantic MediaWiki][smw] but it is highly recommended to
use them together in order for summaries to generate individual content (e.g. property
that contains short description, image property, known keywords, modification date etc.)
while building a summary.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.5 or later
- MediaWiki 1.25 or later

## Installation

The recommended way to install SummaryCards is by using [Composer][composer] with
an entry in MediaWiki's `composer.json`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"mediawiki/summary-cards": "~1.0"
	}
}
```
1. From your MediaWiki installation directory, execute
   `composer require mediawiki/summary-cards:~1.0`
2. Navigate to _Special:Version_ on your wiki and verify that the package
   have been successfully installed.
